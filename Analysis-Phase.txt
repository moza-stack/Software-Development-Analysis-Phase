1.The Analysis Phase in Software Development 

 

Define the analysis phase and its importance in the software development lifecycle 

The analysis phase is the stage where system analysts work with stakeholders (users, clients, and managers) to gather, study, and document functional and non-functional requirements of the software. 

The analysis phase is crucial because it lays the foundation for all later stages. Its importance includes: 

1. Ensures correct understanding of user needs 

It reduces misunderstandings by clearly defining what users expect from the software. 
A good analysis prevents building the wrong product. 

2. Reduces development cost and time 

Fixing problems in requirements early is much cheaper than fixing them after coding or deployment. 
Analysis helps avoid costly rework. 

3. Guides system design 

The design phase depends entirely on the requirements gathered here. 
Without clear requirements, designers cannot create proper system architecture. 

4. Minimizes project risks 

Unclear requirements are one of the main reasons projects fail. 
Thorough analysis helps prevent scope creep, incorrect assumptions, and technical risks. 

5. Improves communication among stakeholders 

It creates a shared understanding between: 

Developers 

Clients 

Project managers 

End users 

This alignment ensures everyone works toward the same goal. 

6. Provides measurable requirements 

Requirements documented in this phase become benchmarks for: 

Testing 

Validation 

Quality assurance 

Describe each sub-step of the analysis phase in detail 

1. Requirement Elicitation (Gathering Requirements) 

This is the stage where the team collects all needed information about the system. 

What happens here? 

Meeting with stakeholders (clients, managers, end users). 

Observing existing workflows. 

Conducting interviews, surveys, workshops. 

Studying current systems or competitor systems. 

2. Requirement Identification and Classification 

After collecting information, the team organizes and categorizes it. 

What happens here? 

Distinguishing functional requirements 
(features: login, booking, payments). 

Identifying non-functional requirements 
(performance, security, scalability, usability). 

Grouping requirements by modules or business areas. 

Removing contradictions or duplicates. 

3. Requirement Analysis and Validation 

This is a deep investigation stage. 

What happens here? 

Checking if requirements are clear, complete, and feasible. 

Identifying missing or conflicting requirements. 

Asking clarification questions to stakeholders. 

Prioritizing requirements (critical → optional). 

Performing risk analysis (e.g., budget, technical limitations). 

4. System Modeling (Creating Diagrams) 

This step translates requirements into visual models that explain how the system works. 

Common models created: 

Use Case Diagrams – show interactions between users and the system. 

Activity Diagrams – show workflows and processes. 

Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) – show how data moves through the system. 

Class Diagrams – show the structure of system entities. 

Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) – show database tables and relationships. 

5. Feasibility Study 

Before moving forward, the team checks if the project is realistic. 

Types of feasibility: 

Technical Feasibility 
(Do we have the technology and skills?) 

Economic Feasibility 
(Will the benefits outweigh the cost?) 

Operational Feasibility 
(Will users accept and use the system?) 

Schedule Feasibility 
(Can it be built within the required time?) 

Legal Feasibility 
(Does it comply with regulations?) 

6. Requirement Documentation (SRS Creation) 

Here the team prepares the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. 

What the SRS contains: 

Functional and non-functional requirements. 

System models and diagrams. 

User stories or use cases. 

Constraints and assumptions. 

Acceptance criteria. 

The SRS is reviewed and signed by stakeholders. 

7. Requirement Review and Approval 

All stakeholders verify the final requirements. 

What happens here? 

Reviewing each requirement for clarity. 

Confirming that all stakeholder needs are included. 

Ensuring there are no contradictions. 

Getting formal approval (sign-off). 

Explain the deliverables and outcomes of this phase 

 

Deliverables and Outcomes of the Analysis Phase 

The Analysis Phase focuses on understanding the problem, clarifying requirements, and defining what the system must accomplish. By the end of this phase, the team should have a complete picture of what needs to be built — not how. 

Key Deliverables 

1. Business Requirements Document (BRD) 

Describes the high-level goals of the system. 

Explains why the project exists and what business problems it solves. 

2. Functional Requirements Document (FRD) 

Details what the system should do. 

Includes descriptions of features, inputs, outputs, validations, and interactions. 

Often supported by: 

Use cases 

User stories 

Process descriptions 

3. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) 

These specify system qualities, such as: 

Performance (e.g., response time) 

Security requirements 

Scalability 

Reliability 

Usability 

4. Use Case Diagrams and Descriptions 

Visual or written models showing how users (actors) will interact with the system. 

Helps both technical and non-technical stakeholders understand system behavior. 

5. Data Models / ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) 

Defines the data structure for the system. 

Shows tables, relationships, attributes, and data flows. 

6. Process Models 

Common examples include: 

Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) 

Flowcharts 

Activity diagrams 
These illustrate how information moves through the system. 

7. Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) 

Ensures every requirement is tracked from definition → design → testing. 

Helps avoid missing or unclear requirements. 

 

Key Outcomes of the Analysis Phase 

1. Clear Understanding of User Needs 

The team gains a shared understanding of: 

What the customer wants 

What the system must achieve 

Which features are essential 

2. Reduced Ambiguity and Miscommunication 

Ambiguities in requirements are resolved early, preventing mistakes later in development. 

3. Well-Defined Scope 

The scope becomes clear, helping: 

Prevent scope creep 

Improve cost estimation 

Improve timeline accuracy 

4. Foundation for Design Phase 

All documents flow directly into the Design Phase, where technical architecture is created based on these requirements. 

5. Stakeholder Agreement 

At the end of the Analysis Phase: 

All stakeholders review and approve the requirements. 

This approval acts as a contract and a reference for future work. 

 

 

Discuss best practices and common challenges 

 

Engage Stakeholders Early and Continuously 

Use Clear and Structured Requirement-Gathering Techniques 

Document Requirements with Precision 

Prioritize Requirements 

Validate Requirements With Stakeholders 

Create Models and Diagrams

Common Challenges 

1. Unclear or Changing Requirements 

2. Lack of Stakeholder Involvement 

3. Communication Gaps 

4. Overly Complex or Too General Requirements 

5. Time Pressure 

6. Conflicts Between Stakeholders 

7. Inadequate Documentation 

8. Ignoring Technical Feasibility
