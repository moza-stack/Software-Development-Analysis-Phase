Provide a comprehensive example applying all concepts above to a banking system 

 

Absolutely! Let’s put together a comprehensive, end-to-end example of applying user stories, backlog creation and prioritization, story point estimation, acceptance criteria, and Scrum framework concepts to a banking system. I’ll structure this step by step so you can see how everything ties together. 

 

 

Examples for a Banking System: 

Account Management 

As a customer, I want to create a new bank account so that I can start saving or managing my money. 

As a customer, I want to view my account balance so that I can monitor my finances. 

Transactions 

As a customer, I want to transfer money to another account so that I can pay bills or send funds to others. 

As a customer, I want to deposit or withdraw money via an ATM so that I can access cash conveniently. 

Security 

As a customer, I want to enable two-factor authentication so that I can secure my account from unauthorized access. 

As a bank admin, I want to block a suspicious account so that I can prevent fraud. 

Notifications 

As a customer, I want to receive email or SMS alerts for transactions so that I can track activity on my account. 

 

 

 

Create a complete product backlog with properly weighted user stories
