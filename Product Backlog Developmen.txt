Explain what a product backlog is and its purpose 

A Product Backlog is a prioritized, evolving list of everything that needs to be built in a product. It is one of the core artifacts in Scrum and serves as the single source of truth for all work the team may do in the future. 

1. Organize and Prioritize Work 

2. Provide Transparency 

3. Guide Sprint Planning 

4. Enable Adaptation 

5. Align Stakeholders 

 

Describe how to create and structure a product backlog 

1. Start with the Product Vision 

2. Gather Requirements 

3. Create Backlog Items 

4. Prioritize the Backlog 

5. Refine (Groom) the Backlog Regularly 

6. Structure the Backlog 

7. Add Estimates 

8. Keep the Backlog Transparent 

Discuss backlog prioritization techniques 

Backlog prioritization is the process of deciding what to build first so the team delivers maximum value early and continuously. Many techniques exist, each suited for different contexts. Below is a clear and practical overview of the most widely used backlog prioritization techniques, their purpose, strengths, and when to use each. 

 

Explain backlog refinement and maintenance 

 

Backlog Refinement 

Backlog refinement is a continuous process where the Product Owner and the development team review and update the Product Backlog to ensure items are clear, detailed, and prioritized. 

What happens during refinement? 

1. Clarifying User Stories 

Breaking large items (epics) into smaller, clear stories 

Adding missing details, acceptance criteria, and business rules 

2. Estimating 

The team assigns effort estimates (e.g., story points) 

Helps forecast sprint capacity and planning 

3. Reprioritizing 

Items are ordered based on: 

Business value 

Urgency 

Dependencies 

Risk 

4. Removing or Updating Items 

Removing outdated or irrelevant items 

Modifying stories as business needs evolve 

Why backlog refinement is important 

Ensures the team always has “ready” items to pick for the next sprint 

Reduces confusion during Sprint Planning 

Improves delivery flow and predictability 

Aligns the backlog with the current business goals 

 

Backlog Maintenance 

Backlog maintenance refers to the ongoing management of the backlog to keep it clean, consistent, and relevant over time. 

Activities involved in maintenance: 

1. Keeping the backlog organized 

Making sure items follow a consistent format 

Checking that all stories have acceptance criteria 

2. Regularly updating items 

Adding new stories based on feedback or new requirements 

Updating existing items when business priorities change 

3. Ensuring correct prioritization 

Continually verifying the top items truly bring the most value 

4. Managing dependencies and risks 

Identifying technical, design, or external dependencies 

Adjusting items to reduce delivery risks 

5. Ensuring items meet the Definition of Ready (DoR) 

Confirming stories are “ready” to be worked on before entering the sprint
